Write your python code to implement K ways normalized cut k=3
a. Use RBF kernel with gamma = {0.01,0.1,1,10}. Which of these gamma values 
produces a connected graph? Plot the normalized eigenvectors using (Y vectors as 
in pseudo code) scatter3d.
b. Use Similarity graph as the 3-NN graph. Where Sim(xi,xj)=1 iff xj is one of the 
nearest three points to xi (or vise-versa ). Plot the normalized eigenvectors using 
(Y vectors as in pseudo code) scatter3d.
